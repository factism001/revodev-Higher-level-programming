            Learning Objectives
            -------------------

            At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/FPJvEE-DRJDvmVTNWeFR8A "explain to anyone"), **without the help of Google**:

            ### General

            -   You must be able to draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops track projects
            -   You must be able to explain what each component is doing
            -   You must be able to explain system redundancy
            -   Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS

            Requirements
            ------------

            ### General

            -   A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
            -   For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper or software or your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram
            -   This project will be manually reviewed:
            -   As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green
            -   Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use [imgur](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/m_O2HLsKrO1zg31LMcLOGQ "imgur") but feel free to use anything you want).
            -   For the following tasks, insert the link from of your screenshot into the answer file
            -   After pushing your answer file to GitHub, insert the GitHub file link into the URL box
            -   You will also have to whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff or student - no computer or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session
            -   Focus on what you are being asked:
            -   Cover what the requirements mention, we will explore details in a later project
            -   Keep in mind that you will have 30 minutes to perform the exercise, you will get points for what is asked in requirements
            -   Similarly in a job interview, you should answer what the interviewer asked for, be careful about being too verbose - always ask the interviewer if going into details is necessary - speaking too much can play against you
            -   In this project, again, avoid going in details if not asked
