            [![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/holbertonschool-sysadmin_devops/294/tWUPWmR.png)](https://youtu.be/rp5cVMNmbro)[](http://savefrom.net/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2Frp5cVMNmbro&utm_source=userjs-chrome&utm_medium=extensions&utm_campaign=link_modifier "Obtenir un lien direct")

            Any software system will eventually fail, and that failure can come stem from a wide range of possible factors: bugs, traffic spikes, security issues, hardware failures, natural disasters, human error... Failing is normal and failing is actually a great opportunity to learn and improve. Any great Software Engineer must learn from his/her mistakes to make sure that they won't happen again. Failing is fine, but failing twice because of the same issue is not.

            A postmortem is a tool widely used in the tech industry. After any outage, the team(s) in charge of the system will write a summary that has 2 main goals:

            -   To provide the rest of the company's employees easy access to information detailing the cause of the outage. Often outages can have a huge impact on a company, so managers and executives have to understand what happened and how it will impact their work.
            -   And to ensure that the root cause(s) of the outage has been discovered and that measures are taken to make sure it will be fixed.
