            Vagrant
            =======

            Concepts
            ---------
            *For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:*

            [Vagrant - or - how to code in your local computer](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/4m4Lw9rUZFhQig7NZUF80w "Vagrant - or - how to code in your local computer")
            
            Vagrant - or - how to code in your local computer
            -------------------------------------------------
            Sandboxes are great, but you can also do your ALX assessments on your local computer - having a virtual machine (VM) is the perfect tool for that.
            
            Let’s dig into Vagrant today!
            
            *Also:*
            -   This project is 100% optional
            -   This project can’t be done in Sandboxes - it can be done only in your local computer.
