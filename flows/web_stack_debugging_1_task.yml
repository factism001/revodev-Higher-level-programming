        ### 0\. Nginx likes port 80

        mandatory

        Score: 0.00% (Checks completed: 0.00%)

        Using your debugging skills, find out what's keeping your Ubuntu container's Nginx installation from listening on port `80`. Feel free to install whatever tool you need, start and destroy as many containers as you need to debug the issue. Then, write a Bash script with the minimum number of commands to automate your fix.

        Requirements:

        -   Nginx must be running, and listening on port `80` of all the server's active IPv4 IPs
        -   Write a Bash script that configures a server to the above requirements

        ```
        root@966c5664b21f:/# curl 0:80
        curl: (7) Failed to connect to 0 port 80: Connection refused
