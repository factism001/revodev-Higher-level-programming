        ### 0\. My first postmortem

        mandatory

        [![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/holbertonschool-sysadmin_devops/294/pQ9YzVY.gif)](https://twitter.com/devopsreact/status/834887829486399488)

        Using one of the web stack debugging project issue or an outage you have personally face, write a postmortem. Most of you will never have faced an outage, so just get creative and invent your own :)

        Requirements:

        -   Issue Summary (that is often what executives will read) must contain:
            -   duration of the outage with start and end times (including timezone)
            -   what was the impact (what service was down/slow? What were user experiencing? How many % of the users were affected?)
            -   what was the root cause
        -   Timeline (format bullet point, format: `time` - `keep it short, 1 or 2 sentences`) must contain:

            -   when was the issue detected
            -   how was the issue detected (monitoring alert, an engineer noticed something, a customer complained...)
            -   actions taken (what parts of the system were investigated, what were the assumption on the root cause of the issue)
            -   misleading investigation/debugging paths that were taken
            -   which team/individuals was the incident escalated to
            -   how the incident was resolved
        -   Root cause and resolution must contain:

            -   explain in detail what was causing the issue
            -   explain in detail how the issue was fixed
        -   Corrective and preventative measures must contain:

            -   what are the things that can be improved/fixed (broadly speaking)
            -   a list of tasks to address the issue (be very specific, like a TODO, example: patch Nginx server, add monitoring on server memory...)
        -   Be brief and straight to the point, between 400 to 600 words

        While postmortem format can vary, stick to this one so that you can get properly reviewed by your peers.

            ### 1\. Make people want to read your postmortem

            #advanced

            We are constantly stormed by a quantity of information, it's tough to get people to read you.

            Make your post-mortem attractive by adding humour, a pretty diagram or anything that would catch your audience attention.
